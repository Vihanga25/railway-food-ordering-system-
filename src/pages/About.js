        Sri Lanka Railways is a government department under the Ministry of Transport. As a major transport provider and the only railway transport organization in the country, Sri Lanka Railways has now expanded its services to include convenient and reliable food ordering for passengers. Initially focusing on goods rather than passengers, we have evolved to prioritize passenger needs, including meal services during their journeys.
